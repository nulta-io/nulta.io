-------- <h1> Nulta-io </h1> ---------                                       | [man] command call |

As you can see TLR design draws design, for its programmatic concept(NULTA) from Bash(bourne-again shell dessign pattern).
To explore more of it transfer to next address: http://nulta.io             
Comming soon:  ->  https:// will have to be implemented to use commands like [stream]                 

printl:  [${v}] [-strings]    -writes to terminal line reader
                               simplest possible output;
echo:    [${v}] [-strings]    -writes to terminal line reader with evaluation complex output;

      [fluid's] can change, [cruds] can not!
      </br>

      There is 5 built in fluids, which can be overwritten:
      $1, $2, $3, $4 AND $i

      AS ALWAYS, SPACES ARE IMPORTANT!

  SPACES ARE IMPORTANT!

       [..] two dots in brackets indicates many inputs
       [|] line in brackets indicates OR
       {}  some commands use special characters in order to work
       EXAMPLE:

      I read commands like this:

      EXAMPLE:  ls 1 2 3
      hit [Enter] to confirm command
      hit [ArrowUp] to repeat last command
      hit [key:| 220 ] to pipeline 2 command
      $          -indicates fluids. Changeable variables.
      *          -indicates CRUDS.  Non-Changeable built-in.
      SPACES are important!

      ERROR's are marked color [red] 
      EBAD    &nbsp;   ~bad-request  &nbsp; non-valid form
      EMPT    &nbsp;   ~empty        &nbsp; not-assigned
      ECRUD   &nbsp;   ~to-crud      &nbsp; tried-assign-to-crud

      Returned EMPTY line indicates false result of command,
      except for new CRUD and FLUID assign.

      Program will try, to help you, understand what happened.

      Once you start writing TLR lines think of it, just like
      that. Command lines, one by one. One, can do anything on
      single line.
      One can include libraries, that can bread new life into your
      programming. EXAMPLE: include canvas graphic to
      represent data, with many different shapes.

      use:  include gameon                                             #this includes library
            script create_canvas(100,200, 'myCanvas', document.body)   #create canvas on document

      By using tunel command, one, can simulate COMMAND CENTAR and
      invoke any app.

      TLR carries code name NULTA ø meaning ZERO/GROUND. Think of it just like that.

    Programmed by Petar Sladojevic in year 2020
    Built on-top of Javascript, inspired by [Bash] programming language.
    Designed for simplicity, born in minimalism.

    Software can be used here on address:   [ www.nulta.io ]

    Concept of NULTA
    -------------------


    Nulta is concept, programmatic paradigm, and ongoing project.
    New Commands, will be added to original source code.
    Nulta represents foundation, on which level 1 software can grow.
    Ground is Nulta. Nulta is the ground.


     level 2   products of [level 1]     images, code, art etc
     level 1   ART NULTA    Diana    CHESS2020  ...
     level 0          Terminal Line Reader (TLR)
     ___________________________________________________
     -1        foreign servers always connected


    TLR is a programmatic interpreter.
    level 1 contains built-in projects that sit on the NULTA[ground],
    ready to flower. Once used, they breed secondary products.
    EXAMPLE: pattern images made with ART NULTA.

    With TLR you investigate, control, monitor,
    and write small programs write there, on the spot.
    It is programmatic in that sense that his built-ins are easy,
    fast, powerful and ready for usage in just couple of parameters.
    You can write commands and invoke programs with TLR.

    TLR lives on ONE line. You can do anything, on one line.

    TLR is made out of COMMANDS. Pre-made combos of many
    functions and variables.
    You use TLR, like this.

           sum 100 201 300
            ^   ^   ^   ^
      COMMAND   P1  P2  P3

      P1,P2,P3 = parameters

    TLR includes two main VARIABLE FORMS, beside COMMANDS,
    and they are called fluid and Crud.
    FLUIDS can change, they are marked with [$] sign.
    CRUDS  cannot change, ever, they are marked with [*]

    Define new fluids and crud's like this:
    $ a = 10      #fluid

    $ *pi = 3.14  #crud

    With TLR you call javascript anytime, you need it.
    TLR can evaluate things using javascript, this alone opens a world of options.
